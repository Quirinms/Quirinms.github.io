Scientific approaches should be evaluated very carefully, critically and extensively discussed, as well as tested in real life.
On that account, please be most sceptical about anything you read on my website.
It serves to propose data science ideas I hold or which I was taught.
They may sometimes be hard to prove or contrary to common opinion.
Occasionally, they are being published in peer-reviewed journals (see my publications) if I decide that my free time is worth the effort.
My focus with regard to data science lies on data visualization, dimensionality reduction, clustering and knowledge discovery, time series analysis, swarm intelligence, self-organization and emergence, game theory and every algorithm derived from effects found in nature.
However, improvement of data science methods and approaches is only my hobby.
This is the reason why not every idea, which is or will be presented on this website, is going to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Moreover, not every idea presented here is my own.
If you find my ideas worth using please cite me accordingly.
